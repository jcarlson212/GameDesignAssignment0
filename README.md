# GameDesignAssignment0


This was an assignment from Harvard's cs50 game developement class. The link is here: https://docs.cs50.net/games/2020/x/assignments/0/assignment0.html

The code that I changed was mostly in main.lua. In particular, I made it so that one of the paddles moves on its own. I also fixed a bug that was making it not run on my system.
