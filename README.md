# GameDesignAssignment0


This was an assignment from Harvard's cs50 game developement class. The link is here: https://docs.cs50.net/games/2020/x/assignments/0/assignment0.html

The code that I changed was mostly in main.lua. In particular, I made it so that one of the paddles moves on its own. I also fixed a bug that was making it not run on my system.

How to play: download the files and put them all in the same folder. Drag the assignment0 folder on top of love.exe and the game should run. To start a round, press enter. The ball should then move in a random direction. To move up and down, use w and s.
